Golang selfhosted Status/Healthcheck monitoring app.

Mostly just a project to test [temporal.io](https://temporal.io/).

### Expected features
 - [ ] SSO or just expect to be run behind a auth proxy.
 - [ ] Abbility for multiple instances/workers.
   - Otherwise using a cronjob would do the job, no need for temporal.
 - [ ] Some nice UI to try out [htmx](https://htmx.org/).
